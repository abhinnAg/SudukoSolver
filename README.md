# SudukoSolver
Preliminary Program to solve sudokus which have a valid solution and don't require guessing (yet).


Uses an implementation of dancing links with a twist of constraint settings. 

Stuff to do now :-

1. Implement a code which solves sudokus which require a bit of guessing
2. Building a front page that takes in input and outputs something.
3. Building a ML feature that takes in images of sudokus and outputs the result.
