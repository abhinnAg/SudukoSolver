# SudukoSolver
Preliminary Program to solve sudokus.


Uses an implementation of dancing links with a twist of constraint settings. 

Stuff to do now :-

1. Implement a code which solves sudokus which require a bit of guessing - Done. 
2. Building a front page that takes in input and outputs something.
3. Building a ML feature that takes in images of sudokus and outputs the result.
4. Feature to generate a suduko.
5. Feature which tells how to solve a suduko.
